### Browser based Job finder 

This  script demonstrates my expertise in developing and managing end-to-end automation pipelines using **Python**, **Selenium**, **Telegram APIs**, **regular expressions**, and **web scraping libraries** like BeautifulSoup. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the key technical aspects :

---

#### **Core Functionality**:
1. **Web Scraping and Automation**:
   - Utilizes **Selenium** to dynamically interact with websites, handle login workflows, and extract real-time data.
   - Employs customized **ChromeOptions** to preserve session data and ensure seamless automation.
   - Integrates **regular expressions (regex)** for parsing structured and unstructured data, optimizing content extraction workflows.
   - Demonstrates the ability to adapt scraping patterns for multiple website architectures (e.g., LinkedIn, Greenhouse, etc.).

2. **Data Persistence**:
   - Implements a robust mechanism to store and retrieve scraped data using **JSON files**, ensuring data integrity across sessions.
   - Compares current and previous data states to detect and notify changes efficiently.

3. **Real-Time Notifications**:
   - Leverages the **Telegram Bot API** to send alerts when significant changes (e.g., new job postings) are detected.
   - Includes dynamic handling for message customization and error recovery, ensuring reliability.

4. **Pattern Testing and Optimization**:
   - Embeds a testing workflow for validating regex patterns against live web pages, reflecting attention to accuracy and adaptability.

---

#### **Advanced Features**:

   - Incorporates tools like **BeautifulSoup** and **Requests** for static page scraping, complementing Selenium's dynamic capabilities.

 **Scalable Job Monitoring**:
   - Supports monitoring multiple URLs simultaneously by mapping each to specific regex patterns.
   - Allows easy integration of new URLs and patterns, reflecting a scalable architecture.

---

#### **Technical Highlights**:
- **Programming Languages**: Proficient in Python, with extensive use of its libraries like Selenium, BeautifulSoup, JSON, and logging modules.
- **Web Technologies**: Hands-on experience with dynamic and static web scraping techniques, handling JavaScript-heavy websites using browser automation.
- **API Integration**: Practical knowledge of integrating third-party APIs (e.g., Telegram Bot API) for notification systems.
- **Regex Expertise**: Mastery in crafting complex regular expressions for parsing HTML and JSON data formats.


### Why This Script Matters:
This project exemplifies my ability to **conceptualize, develop, and deploy scalable automation systems**. It reflects my strong technical foundation in:
- **Web scraping and data extraction** for real-time insights.
- **API-driven notifications** for proactive communication.
- **End-to-end automation pipelines** that integrate multiple technologies seamlessly.
